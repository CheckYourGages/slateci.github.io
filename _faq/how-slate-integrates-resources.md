SLATE will provide the a “substrate” to host your backend services connecting web
portal frameworks to HPC and storage resources.  For example, if your gateway
requires a Globus endpoint or Open Science Grid "compute element” where there is
none, SLATE can be use to quickly deploy the needed service.  The benefits of SLATE
for developers of distributed systems have more tools available to practice a
DevOps programming model over wide area resources.
