When fully developed, SLATE will simplify the deployment and operation of services
necessary for your research community.  For example, if you have research groups on
campus requiring a domain specific task scheduler or science gateway, SLATE will
provide the framework to pull containerized service images from trusted repositories
and operate them with minimal effort or specific expertise.
