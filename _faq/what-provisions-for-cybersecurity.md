The SLATE team is actively working with the cybersecurity officers of our
participating institutions to ensure best practices in systems management.
We are will also be working with the
[Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure](http://trustedci.org/)
to periodically assess and review the trust model and underlying assumptions
on balancing risk and science benefit.
