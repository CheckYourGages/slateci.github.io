A collection of SLATE edge clusters managed as a single entity.
There can be more than one SLATE platform and a SLATE edge provider may
decide to join more than one.

Examples:
* The SLATE Reference Platform
* OSG uses SLATE underneath to distribute their services
* A small university deploys a SLATE cluster to join both OSG and PRP and an eventual  NRP
