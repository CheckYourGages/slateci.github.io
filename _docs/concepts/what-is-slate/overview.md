The high level goal of SLATE is to facilitate creation of multi-institutional science computing systems by augmenting the canonical [Science DMZ pattern](http://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/) with a generic, programmable, secure and trusted **underlayment** platform. This platform permits hosting of advanced container-centric services needed for higher-level capabilities such as [data transfer nodes](http://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/DTN/), software and data caches, workflow services and science gateway components. SLATE will use best-of-breed data center virtualization components, and where available, software defined networking, to enable distributed automation of deployment and service lifecycle management tasks by domain experts. As such it will simplify creation of scalable platforms that connect research teams, institutions and resources to accelerate science while reducing operational costs and development cycle times.
