The [SLATE Vocabulary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDWsV5EN7ZJP3UlJ3qxSrhK0Sp-f-9Qv7cL2guCkRgM/edit?usp=sharing) document sets a common language for reference for a SLATE site, roles, and software components. 

The [SLATE Architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18F1qV3WGmcz7fxr95aCUAgR-_qqz1iQEAMF-AFTsuoE/edit?usp=sharing) document (DRAFT) attempts to document the various components of SLATE.
