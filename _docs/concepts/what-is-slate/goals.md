We have goals!  Here are the overarching SLATE design drivers:

* It must be DevOps friendly for multi-campus platform builders and science gateway deployers
* Allow for quick patch updates, release iterations, and fast tracking of new capabilities
* Use best of breed open source technologies for growth and sustainability
* Provide centralized monitoring & analytics for all layers in the system - edge clusters, applications
* Collaborate with national cyberinfrastructure for science projects

A reference ("figurative") architecture of the system:

More information:

* The [SLATE Vocabulary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDWsV5EN7ZJP3UlJ3qxSrhK0Sp-f-9Qv7cL2guCkRgM/edit?usp=sharing) document sets a common language for reference for a SLATE site, roles, and software components. 

* The [SLATE Architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18F1qV3WGmcz7fxr95aCUAgR-_qqz1iQEAMF-AFTsuoE/edit?usp=sharing) document (DRAFT) attempts to document the various components of SLATE.
