Active measurement is a key component of the SLATE infrastructure.  SLATE uses [perfSONAR](https://www.perfsonar.net/) as one of its key components for measuring data paths between [SLATE Edge Clusters](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/hardware-components/edge-cluster.html).  A [SLATE platform](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/hardware-components/platform.html) maintains a central repository and visualization of the data path connectivity between clusters.
