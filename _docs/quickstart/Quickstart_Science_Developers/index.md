Welcome Science Developer!  

Anxious to get started and want to see what the SLATE command line looks like?  

Try the basic SLATE tutorial:  
<a href="https://sandbox.slateci.io:5000"><button class="btn btn-slate">Try SLATE now!</button></a>

Ahh, you are a real developer and want to jump right into a SLATE environment?  

Grab the mini-slate development environment.  
<a href="https://github.com/slateci/minislate"><button class="btn btn-slate">Get a mini-slate dev kit</button></a>   
You will have a small version of the whole SLATE reference platform and you will be able to grab existing packages in the SLATE stable and dev catalogs.  If you are using the dev catalog, don't forget the "--dev" flag!  ;-)
