An important principle in management of edge services in research computing centers, and their ScienceDMZs, is autonomy.  


<!--end_excerpt-->

A local site admin
istrator should have full confidence and control over which edge services are scheduled on their local Kubernetes cluster.  SLATE addresses
this by introducing a command line interface that scopes privilege to the virtual organization managers, i.e. the owners of the service.
